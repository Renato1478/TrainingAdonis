# This is a Adonis FullStack App

## Setup
or manually clone the repo and then run `npm install`.

### Migrations
Run the following command to run startup migrations.
```js
adonis migration:run
```
### Starting the App
```js
adonis serve --dev
```

Now is just access your localhost:3333/login on browser, create an User and access.

### Application Concept
  This app basically consists in a project for my learnings in the AdonisJS framework. 

  The website is to help pets and adopters to find each other, sending adoption requests to owners that will have an account in the application,
  being possibly to find your little buddy on the dashboard or leaving the pet for adoption if you can't take care of the animal.
  
### I'm not actually working on this idea in this repository
  
  But feel free to contribute.
  
  I have continued this project, but in other stacks and frameworks. I've just decided to develop this ideas with more affection,
  making the project by the absolute 0, by the design to execution.
